During my university career and through my courses, I dabbled in python, java, and C to learn the fundamentals of computer science. Upon graduation, I took the course 100 Days of Swift by Hacking with Swift to learn more about iOS development. I am currently working at Yardi which is a property management software company that hosted through the web which peaked my interest in web development. I am currently learning about HTML, CSS, Javascript and learning the essential tools such as node, express, databases, and more. \");\n          i0.ɵɵelementEnd()()();\n        }\n        if (rf & 2) {\n          i0.ɵɵadvance(6);\n          i0.ɵɵtextInterpolate1(\" I am \", ctx.age, \" years old and have a passion for technology. Growing up during the time that technology was advancing rapidly, I got to experience the good and the bad it had to offer. I did not get my first computer until around the year 2005-2006. The first computer I used was an old eMachine running on Windows 98 with a notably heavy CRT monitor. I did not get to experience the internet until a couple years after that. From then on, my interest in technology developed. I started looking into tinkering game consoles such as the PSP to play downloaded games. Most notably by that time, YouTube was becoming popular which opened a new door for my interest. I started keeping myself up to date in the world of technology through Youtube. Fast forward to highschool, I found that I was becoming interested in computer programming but didn't know where to start. It wasn't until my last year of highschool that I finally took the first step into taking a class about it and set off from there. \");\n        }\n      },\n      styles: [\".aboutMe[_ngcontent-%COMP%]{margin:0 auto;width:65%}#aboutMeTitle[_ngcontent-%COMP%]{padding-top:3rem;text-align:center;font-family:Playfair Display,serif;font-size:48px}#aboutMeParagraph[_ngcontent-%COMP%]{line-height:2}.links[_ngcontent-%COMP%]{margin-bottom:3rem}.linksContainer[_ngcontent-%COMP%]{display:flex;flex-direction:row;justify-content:space-evenly}#linkedin[_ngcontent-%COMP%], #github[_ngcontent-%COMP%]{color:#000;transition:.5s}#linkedin[_ngcontent-%COMP%]:hover, #github[_ngcontent-%COMP%]:hover{transform:scale(1.3)}.footer[_ngcontent-%COMP%]{display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center}\"]\n    });\n  }\n  return DescriptionComponent;\n})();","map":null,"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
