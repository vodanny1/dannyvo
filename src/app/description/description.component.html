      Hello there! I'm Danny, a {{ age }} year old technology enthusiast with a
      burning passion for all things tech-related. I graduated from the
      University of Toronto in 2020, with a degree in Computer Science. Since
      then, I've been on an exhilarating journey through the ever-evolving realm
      of technology, and I'm excited to share my experiences with you on this
      platform.

      My fascination with technology goes beyond mere interest; it's a driving
      force that fuels my creativity and innovation. I am captivated by the way
      technology shapes our lives, connecting us in ways previously
      unimaginable. In the rapidly changing landscape of the digital age, I find
      myself constantly inspired to explore, learn, and create.

      During my academic years, I honed my skills in computer science, mastering
      various programming languages and delving into the intricacies of software
      development. My time at the University of Toronto not only provided me
      with a solid foundation in computer science principles but also nurtured
      my ability to think critically and solve complex problems. These skills
      have become the cornerstone of my professional journey.
