      I am {{ age }} years old and have a passion for technology. Growing up
      during the time that technology was advancing rapidly, I got to experience
      the good and the bad it had to offer. I did not get my first computer
      until around the year 2005-2006. The first computer I used was an old
      eMachine running on Windows 98 with a notably heavy CRT monitor. I did not
      get to experience the internet until a couple years after that. From then
      on, my interest in technology developed. I started looking into tinkering
      game consoles such as the PSP to play downloaded games. Most notably by
      that time, YouTube was becoming popular which opened a new door for my
      interest. I started keeping myself up to date in the world of technology
      through Youtube. Fast forward to highschool, I found that I was becoming
      interested in computer programming but didn't know where to start. It
      wasn't until my last year of highschool that I finally took the first step
      into taking a class about it and set off from there.

      I graduated from the University of Toronto in June 2020 studying
      Statistics and Computer Science. During my university career and through
      my courses, I dabbled in python, java, and C to learn the fundamentals of
      computer science. Upon graduation, I took the course 100 Days of Swift by
      Hacking with Swift to learn more about iOS development. I am currently
      working at Yardi which is a property management software company that
      hosted through the web which peaked my interest in web development. I am
      currently learning about HTML, CSS, Javascript and learning the essential
      tools such as node, express, databases, and more.
