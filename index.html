            I am 23 years old and have a passion for technology. Growing up
            during the time that technology was advancing rapidly, I got to
            experience the good and the bad it had to offer. I did not get my
            first computer until around the year 2005-2006. The first computer I
            used was an old eMachine running on Windows 98 with a notably heavy
            CRT monitor. I did not get to experience the internet until a couple
            years after that. From then on, my interest in technology developed.
            I started looking into tinkering game consoles such as the PSP to
            play downloaded games. Most notably by that time, YouTube was
            becoming popular which opened a new door for my interest. I started
            keeping myself up to date in the world of technology through
            Youtube. Fast forward to highschool, I found that I was becoming
            interested in computer programming but didn't know where to start.
            It wasn't until my last year of highschool that I finally took the
            first step into taking a class about it and set off from there.

            <br />
            <br />
            I graduated from the University of Toronto in June 2020 studying
            Statistics and Computer Science. During my university career and
            through my courses, I dabbled in python, java, and C to learn the
            fundamentals of computer science. Upon graduation, I took the course
            100 Days of Swift by Hacking with Swift to learn more about iOS
            development. I am currently working at Yardi which is a property
            management software company that hosted through the web which peaked
            my interest in web development. I am currently learning about HTML,
            CSS, Javascript and learning the essential tools such as node,
            express, databases, and more.
