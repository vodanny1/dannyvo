            <p id="aboutMeParagraph">
                I am 23 years old and have a passion for technology. Growing up during the time
                that
                technology was advancing rapidly, I got to experience the good and the bad it had to offer. I did not
                get my
                first computer until around the year 2005-2006. The first computer I used was an old eMachine running on
                Windows 98 with a notably heavy CRT monitor. I did not get to experience the internet until a couple
                years
                after that. From then on, my interest in technology developed. I started looking into tinkering game
                consoles such as the PSP to play downloaded games. Most notably by that time, YouTube was becoming
                popular
                which opened a new door for my interest. I started keeping myself up to date in the world of technology
                through Youtube. Fast forward to highschool, I found that I was becoming interested in computer
                programming
                but didn't know where to start. It wasn't until my last year of highschool that I finally took the first
                step into taking a class about it and set off from there.

                I graduated from the University of Toronto in June 2020 studying Statistics and Computer Science. During
                my
                university career and through my courses, I dabbled in python, java, and C to learn the fundamentals of
                computer science. Upon graduation, I took the course 100 Days of Swift by Hacking with Swift to learn
                more
                about iOS development. I am currently working at Yardi which is a property management software company
                that
                hosted through the web which peaked my interest in web development.

                I am currently learning about HTML, CSS, Javascript and learning the essential tools such as node,
                express,
                databases, and more.
